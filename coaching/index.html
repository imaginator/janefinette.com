		<p>Coaching is a powerful process that enables you to step into your full potential.  We all possess the capacity for knowing what is best for ourselves. As your coach, I will partner with you to help you reach the goals you set out to achieve. </p>
		<p>In working together you will be guided in thought-provoking and creative approaches. You will garner fresh perspectives, achieve clarity and increase awareness. My role is to encourage, guide, and motivate you through the challenges and opportunities you are facing; and toward the change you want to see. </p>
