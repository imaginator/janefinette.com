		<p>I love people. I believe humanity is powerful and only limited by our own perceived limits. When we as humans realize our own unique purpose, see our true power, fully live our values and step out into the world – great things happen. </p>
		<p>I have spent two decades building and empowering global teams and communities for eBay, Jungle.com, Astia, Mozilla Firefox, Gooru and many others. I founded two consulting practices helping entrepreneurs and communities expand globally, brought two US based software companies to EMEA, and co-founded the non-profit Mentor for Good. I even owned a contemporary art gallery in Berlin. My career has been rich and full, and without exception – building deep rooted connection and meaning has always been my passion.</p>
		<p>Today, I am a Leadership Coach; where I help individuals create and navigate the positive change they want to make in their lives. My clients range from start-up CEOs, professionals at companies such as Google and Mozilla, and many more who have chosen a path toward self-awareness and fulfillment. </p>
		<p>I write and speak about leadership, community, and participation. I am a mentor at <a href="http://unreasonableinstitute.org/">The Unreasonable Institute</a>, <a href="http://unreasonableatsea.com/">The Unreasonable at Sea</a>, <a href="http://www.semesteratsea.org/">Semester at Sea</a>, <a href="http://astia.org/">Astia</a> and many other places.</p>
		<p>My home is sunny California, where I live with my husband <a href="http://finette.com/">Pascal</a>, our horse &amp; two dogs. When not working you can find me riding Atlas in the Saratoga mountains.</p>
