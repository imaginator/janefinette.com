		<p>I love people. I believe customers are citizens, and participation is key to success. I have spent two decades building and empowering global communities for eBay, Jungle.com, Astia, Mozilla Firefox and many others. I founded a consulting practice helping entrepreneurs expand throughout Europe, brought two US based software companies to EMEA, and co-founded the non-profit <a href="http://mentorforgood.org/">Mentor for Good</a>. I even owned a contemporary art gallery in Berlin. My career has been rich and full, and without exception - building deep rooted connection and community has always been my passion.</p>

		<p>Today, I am the Founder of <a href="http://thecommunityfactor.com/">The Community Factor</a>; an agency that helps companies and organizations create extraordinary communities and movements. I organize <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Community-Hacks/">Community Hacks</a>, and lead <a href="http://thecommunityalliance.org/">The Community Alliance</a>; a global group of thought leaders and innovators who are driving fundamental change in business practice to include community participation. I am currently completing an Entrepreneur in Residence term with Astia Global.</p>

		<p>I write and speak about community, participation and force multipliers. I am a mentor at The Unreasonable Institute, Astia and many other places. </p>

		<p>My home is sunny California, where I live with my husband <a href="http://finette.com/">Pascal</a>, our horse &amp; two dogs. When not working you can find me riding Atlas in the Saratoga mountains, and trying not to collect any more art! </p>
